R dataset state.x77 from library(faraway) contains information on 50 states from 1970s collected by US Census Bureau. The goal is to predict ‘life expectancy’ using a combination of remaining variables.
```{r}
library(faraway)
data.state <- as.data.frame(state.x77)|> 
  janitor::clean_names() 
head(data.state)
view(data.state)
```
